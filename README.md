# Kalman-filter
Serveral simple demos of Kalman filter.  

Kalman_filter_basic: Basci Kalman filter for 2-d x-y constant-velocity target tracking.

Kalman_filter_PDA: Kalman filter with probability density association method. It is suitable for the multi-measurement situation, such as weak target tracking or multi-source target tracking.  

Kalman_filter_track_association and Kalman_filter_track_fusion: Kalman filter is applied to multi-receiver situations. Track association and fusion methods are used with Kalman filter.
